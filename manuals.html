        <p>Balancing the demand, second by second, for the supply of gas, electricity and water to businesses and homes

                <p>
                    Fire fighting equipment is equipment designed to extinguish fires or protect the user from fire. It
                    may be used by trained fire fighters, untrained users at the scene of a fire, or built into a
                    building's infrastructure (such as a sprinkler system).

                    Fire fighting equipment includes not only fire hoses and fire extinguishers but also fire-resistant
                    protective clothing, fire-resistant gloves, respirators, and communication equipment.
